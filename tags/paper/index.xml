      <title>Tethered-Bead Immune Sandwich Assay</title>
      <link>http://gwulilab.seas.gwu.edu/post/tethered-bead/</link>

      <guid>http://gwulilab.seas.gwu.edu/post/tethered-bead/</guid>
      <description>Our paper on &amp;ldquo;Tethered-Bead Immune Sandwich Assay&amp;rdquo; has been published in Biosensors and Bioelectronics. This work is a collaboration with Dr. Jonathan Silver (NIH/GW) and Dr. Keir Neuman (NIH). Jon&amp;rsquo;s idea of using a DNA-tethered bead to detect a single immune sandwich complex is a very elegant way to achieve digital, or single molecule, biosensing with minimal equipment. All you need are a low magnification lens and a cellphone camera.</description>
