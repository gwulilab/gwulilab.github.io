# About Our Group

We are a research group at The George Washington University focusing on nanophotonics and microfluidics. Our group is part of the Biomedical Engineering department. We are currently comprised of both graduate and undergraduate students.

Some of our projects include a lab-on-a-chip and a wearable ECG ring. We are actively working on a few different projects at this time in collaboration with multiple groups.
