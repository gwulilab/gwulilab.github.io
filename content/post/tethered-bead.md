Our paper on ["Tethered-Bead Immune Sandwich Assay"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095656631400503X) has been published in Biosensors and Bioelectronics. This work is a collaboration with Dr. Jonathan Silver (NIH/GW) and Dr. Keir Neuman (NIH).
Jon's idea of using a DNA-tethered bead to detect a single immune sandwich complex is a very elegant way to achieve digital, or single molecule, biosensing with minimal equipment. All you need are a low magnification lens and a cellphone camera.
