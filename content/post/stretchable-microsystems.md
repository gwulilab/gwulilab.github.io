Our work on [stretchable and bendable microsystems](http://researchmagazine.gwu.edu/bending-rules) was featured in the GW Research Magazine.

The original paper on soft (i.e. stretchable and bendable) packaging of CMOS electronics with Microfluidics was published in Scientific Reports.

[“Flexible packaging of solid-state integrated circuit chips with elastomeric microfluidics”](http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130122/srep01098/full/srep01098.html), Sci Rep. 3: 1098, 2013.
